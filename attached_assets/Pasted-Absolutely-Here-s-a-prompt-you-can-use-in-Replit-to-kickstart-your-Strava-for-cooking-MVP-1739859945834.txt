### **Replit Project Prompt: Strava for Cooking MVP**

#### **Project Overview**
Build a **minimalist, Gen Z-friendly cooking app** where users can log and track their recipes, share their cooking achievements, and explore a feed of recipes. The app should have a modern, intuitive UI and focus on simplicity and visual appeal.

---

#### **Key Features**
1. **Recipe Logging**:
   - Users can log recipes with:
     - Title
     - Ingredients (bullet points or simple text)
     - Steps (short, easy-to-follow instructions)
     - Photo upload (optional but encouraged)
   - Include a "Quick Add" feature for fast logging.

2. **Recipe Feed**:
   - A visually appealing feed of logged recipes (like Instagram but for food).
   - Display recipe cards with a photo, title, and short description.
   - Infinite scroll for smooth browsing.

3. **Cooking Streaks**:
   - Track how many days in a row a user has cooked.
   - Display a streak counter prominently on the home screen.

4. **Achievements**:
   - Simple badges for milestones (e.g., "First Recipe Logged," "5 Recipes in a Week").
   - Add fun animations when users earn badges.

5. **Search and Filter**:
   - Basic search by recipe name or ingredients.
   - Filters for categories like "Quick Meals," "Desserts," or "Healthy."

6. **Social Sharing**:
   - Allow users to share their recipes on social media (Instagram, TikTok, etc.).
   - Add a "Copy Link" feature for easy sharing.

---

#### **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend**: React (for a modern, responsive UI).
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (for a clean, minimalist design).
- **Backend**: Firebase (for authentication, database, and storage).
- **Database**: Firestore (to store recipes and user data).
- **Image Storage**: Firebase Storage or Cloudinary.
- **Deployment**: Replit’s built-in hosting or Vercel.

---

#### **Steps to Build**
1. **Set Up the Project**:
   - Create a new React project in Replit.
   - Install dependencies: `firebase`, `tailwindcss`, `react-icons`.

2. **Design the UI**:
   - Use Tailwind CSS for a modern, minimalist design.
   - Create a recipe card component for the feed.
   - Add a floating action button (FAB) for adding recipes.

3. **Integrate Firebase**:
   - Set up Firebase Firestore for storing recipes.
   - Add Firebase Storage for image uploads.
   - Example: Create a `firebase.js` file to initialize Firebase.

4. **Build Key Features**:
   - **Recipe Logging**:
     - Create a form with fields for title, ingredients, steps, and photo upload.
     - Save recipes to Firestore.
   - **Recipe Feed**:
     - Fetch and display recipes from Firestore in a grid or list layout.
   - **Cooking Streaks**:
     - Track and display the user’s cooking streak on the home screen.

5. **Add Gamification**:
   - Create achievements and badges using Firestore.
   - Add animations when users earn badges.

6. **Test and Debug**:
   - Use Replit’s live preview feature to test the app in real-time.
   - Debug directly in the browser using Replit’s built-in tools.

7. **Deploy**:
   - Use Replit’s built-in hosting to deploy the app.
   - Alternatively, export the code and deploy to Vercel for better scalability.

#### **Example Code Snippets**
1. **Firebase Setup**:
   ```javascript
   // firebase.js
   import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
   import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";
   import { getStorage } from "firebase/storage";

   const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
     authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
     projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
     storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
     messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
     appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
   };

   const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
   const db = getFirestore(app);
   const storage = getStorage(app);

   export { db, storage };
   ```

2. **Recipe Card Component**:
   ```jsx
   // RecipeCard.js
   const RecipeCard = ({ title,
